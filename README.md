I'm a student, currently trying to learn many things from **back-end** development down to the functioning of general purpose computers. Currently focusing on my **DSA fundamentals** and implementing efficient APIs as I get experience with different environments and tools.

Seeking knowledge, recognition and a crowd to build upon, contributing not only to my own development, but to a community, which is the sense that keeps me eager to learn and sum.

## About the profile
Most of the time, I use GitHub to document my learning or deliver school projects. In the future, it may be filled with good projects, probably focused on a paradigm or technology I'll be trying to learn or get better at. Until there, I'll keep grinding my studies and udpating my roadpath I'm building to get at that point.
